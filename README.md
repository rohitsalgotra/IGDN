# IGDN
Info Grey Dwarf Naked Algorithm

The repository consists of all the data associated with the proposed IGDN algorithm.
Keep in mind:
1) that we are providing the results in the form of mat files and prospective researchers can compare their results with respect to the proposed work.
2) the codes presented here are demo versions of the original codes and final codes will be released after CEC 2024 and GECCO 2024 Competitions (As we are currently working on their enhancements and wish to go for competitions).
3) The stagnation phase which is the salient feature of the new proposed algorithm has been removed in its current representation, and hence results can vary from the results reported in the paper.
